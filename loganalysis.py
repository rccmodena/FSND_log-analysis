""" Log analysis reporting tool

This module was created for the third project of the Udacity's Full
Stack Web Developers Nanodegree, Log Analysis.

The project consists in supposing you've been hired onto a team working
on a newspaper site. The user-facing newspaper site frontend itself, and
the database behind it, are already built and running. The database
contains newspaper articles, as well as the web server log for the site.
The log has a database row for each time a reader loaded a web page.

This script is an internal reporting tool that will use information from
the database `news`, to discover what kind of articles the site's readers
like. The output of the script is shown the three predefined questions
with the respective answers. The questions are:

    1. What are the most popular three articles of all time?
    2. Who are the most popular article authors of all time?
    3. On which days did more than 1% of requests lead to errors?

To help get the answers for the questions, it was created two views:

CREATE VIEW articles_views
AS
SELECT a.title AS title,
	count(b.id) AS number_views,
	a.author AS author
FROM articles a
INNER JOIN log b ON a.slug = substring(b.path, 10)
GROUP BY a.title,
	a.author;

TODO: PUT THE OTHER VIEW CODE


This script requires that `psycopg2` be installed within the Python 2.7
environment you are running this script in. Also it needs that the
database `news` is up and running on PostgreSQL.

This file could also be imported as a module and contains the following
classes and functions:

    * class DBCursor - create a connects to the news db and returns a
    cursor

    * class LogAnalysis - create methods that brings the answer for
    the 3 questions

    * function main - the main function of the script
